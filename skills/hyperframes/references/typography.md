# Typography

The compiler embeds supported fonts — just write `font-family` in CSS.

## Banned fonts

These are the fonts every LLM reaches for. They produce monoculture across compositions even when nothing else about the compositions is similar:

Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Noto Sans, Arimo, Lato, Source Sans, PT Sans, Nunito, Poppins, Outfit, Sora, Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, Bodoni Moda, EB Garamond, Cinzel, Prata, Syne

**Syne in particular** is the most overused "distinctive" display font. When you see it, it reads as AI-generated before anything else about the composition registers.

If a brand's actual identity uses one of these fonts, that's a different situation — use the brand's font. The ban applies to the default-reach, not to the cases where the font is genuinely the right choice.

## Defaults to watch for

These are the patterns that produce same-looking compositions even when the brands are different:

- **Two sans-serifs paired together** — one for headlines, one for body. The pairing has no tension because both fonts come from the same family of forms. Cross the boundary: serif + sans, or sans + mono. The pairing should embody some contradiction in the content.
- **Two expressive fonts in one scene** — one will perform and the other will recede no matter what you do. Pick which font is doing the work and let the other be quiet.
- **Weight contrast at 400 vs 700** — fine for web, invisible at video distance. Video needs more dramatic contrast: 300 vs 900, or 200 vs 800. The weight difference should be readable in motion at a glance.
- **Web type sizes** — body text at 14–16px disappears on a 1920×1080 frame. Video minimums: body 20px+, headlines 60px+, data labels 16px+. If a font-size is under 20px in a composition, there should be a specific reason.

## Principles

What follows isn't a checklist — these are principles for thinking about type in video specifically:

- **Tension should mean something.** When two fonts are paired, the pairing should embody some contradiction the content itself contains — mechanical vs human, public vs private, institutional vs personal. If you can't articulate the tension, the pairing is arbitrary and reads as such.
- **Register switching.** Different fonts can carry different communicative modes — one voice for statements, another for data, another for attribution. This isn't hierarchy on a page; it's voices in a conversation. Each font is saying something different _about_ the content it carries.
- **Tension can live inside a single font.** A font that looks familiar but is secretly strange creates tension with the viewer's expectations — no second font required. Some of the strongest type-driven compositions use one font confidently.
- **One variable changed = dramatic contrast.** Same letterforms, monospaced vs proportional. Same family at different optical sizes. Changing only rhythm while everything else stays constant produces contrast without complexity.
- **Double personality works when fonts share attitude.** Two expressive fonts can coexist if they share an underlying attitude (both irreverent, both precise, both eccentric) even when their visible forms are completely different.
- **Time is hierarchy.** The first element to appear is the most important. In video, sequence replaces position — what would be top-of-page on the web is first-to-enter on screen.
- **Motion is typography.** How a word enters carries as much meaning as the font it's set in. A 0.1s slam and a 2s fade say completely different things with the same letters.
- **Fixed reading time.** Three seconds on screen means the line has to be readable in two. That forces fewer words and larger type than web type-setting habits assume.
- **Tracking tighter than web.** Display sizes in video want `-0.03em` to `-0.05em` of letter-spacing. Video encoding compresses fine letter detail, and tighter tracking compensates.

## Finding Fonts

Don't default to what you know. If the content is luxury, a grotesque sans might create more tension than the expected Didone serif. Decide the register first, then search.

Five categories: trending sans, trending serif, monospace, impact/condensed, script/handwriting. All dynamically filtered from Google Fonts metadata — no hardcoded font names. Cross classification boundaries when pairing.

## Selection Thinking

Don't pick fonts by category reflex (editorial → serif, tech → mono, modern → geometric sans). That's pattern matching, not design.

1. **Name the register.** What voice is the content speaking in? Institutional authority? Personal confession? Technical precision? Casual irreverence? The register narrows the field more than the category.
2. **Think physically.** Imagine the font as a physical object the brand could ship — a museum exhibit caption, a hand-painted shop sign, a 1970s mainframe terminal manual, a fabric label inside a coat, a children's book printed on cheap newsprint, a tax form. Whichever physical object fits the register is pointing at the right _kind_ of typeface.
3. **Reject your first instinct.** The first font that feels right is usually your training-data default for that register. If you picked it last time too, find something else.
4. **Cross-check the assumption.** An editorial brief does NOT need a serif. A technical brief does NOT need a sans. A children's product does NOT need a rounded display font. The most distinctive choice often contradicts the category expectation.

## Similar-Font Pairing

Never pair two fonts that are similar but not identical — two geometric sans-serifs, two transitional serifs, two humanist sans. They create visual friction without clear hierarchy. The viewer senses something is "off" but can't articulate it. Either use one font at two weights, or pair fonts that contrast on multiple axes: serif + sans, condensed + wide, geometric + humanist.

## Dark Backgrounds

Light text on dark backgrounds creates two optical illusions you need to compensate for:

- **Increased apparent weight.** Light-on-dark reads heavier than dark-on-light at the same `font-weight`. Use 350 instead of 400 for body text. Headlines are less affected because size compensates.
- **Tighter apparent spacing.** Light halos around letterforms reduce perceived gaps. Increase `line-height` by 0.05-0.1 beyond your light-background value. For display sizes, add 0.01em `letter-spacing` to counteract.

## OpenType Features for Data

Most fonts ship with OpenType features that are off by default. Turn them on for data compositions:

```css
/* Tabular numbers — digits align vertically in columns */
.stat-value,
.timer,
.data-column {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}

/* Diagonal fractions — renders 1/2 as ½ */
.recipe-amount,
.ratio {
  font-variant-numeric: diagonal-fractions;
}

/* Small caps for abbreviations — less visual shouting */
.abbreviation,
.unit {
  font-variant-caps: all-small-caps;
}

/* Disable ligatures in code — fi, fl, ffi should stay separate */
code,
.code {
  font-variant-ligatures: none;
}
```

`tabular-nums` is essential any time numbers are stacked vertically — stat callouts, timers, scoreboards, data tables. Without it, digits have proportional widths and columns don't align.
