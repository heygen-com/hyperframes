# Project maintenance — keep the pinned CLI current

A scaffolded project pins `hyperframes@<version>` in its `package.json` scripts so renders stay reproducible; the pin never advances on its own, and a pinned run of an older CLI prints no warning about it. When resuming a project whose scripts carry a pin, probe once before the first render-affecting command:

```bash
npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project . --check
```

The probe is read-only and reports the pin against the latest release; keep the explicit `.` — on older CLI releases a bare `--project` followed by another flag consumes that flag as its directory value. When it reports the project behind — or any CLI output already shows it (the stderr notice `This project pins hyperframes@… (latest …)`, or `_meta.updateAvailable: true` in a `--json` result from a pinned script) — apply with `npx hyperframes@latest upgrade --project .`, then verify with `npx hyperframes check`. A passing check confirms the project's compositions still validate on the new version — not that rendered output is frame-identical to the old pin — so a successful bump is never silent: name the old and new version in the run's summary. A project with no composition yet needs no verification. If the check fails, revert the `package.json` change, continue on the pinned version, and report which version the project stays on and why. Act on the signal rather than relaying it to the user; never leave a bumped pin unverified.

Everything else about skill installation — the core-vs-lazy split, what `init` refreshes, diagnosis, CI opt-out, and the no-CLI fallback — lives in `skill-lifecycle.md`.
