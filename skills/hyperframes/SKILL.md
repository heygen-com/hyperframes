description: Create video compositions, animations, title cards, overlays, captions, voiceovers, audio-reactive visuals, and scene transitions in HyperFrames HTML. Use when asked to build any HTML-based video content, add captions or subtitles synced to audio, generate text-to-speech narration, create audio-reactive animation (beat sync, glow, pulse driven by music), add animated text highlighting (marker sweeps, hand-drawn circles, burst lines, scribble, sketchout), or add transitions between scenes (crossfades, wipes, reveals, shader transitions). Covers composition authoring, timing, media, and the full video production workflow. For CLI commands (init, lint, preview, render, transcribe, tts) see the hyperframes-cli skill.

# HyperFrames

HTML is the source of truth for video. A composition is an HTML file with `data-*` attributes for timing, a GSAP timeline for animation, and CSS for appearance. The framework handles clip visibility, media playback, and timeline sync.

## Approach

### Discovery (exploratory requests only)

For open-ended requests ("make me a product launch video", "create something for our brand") where the user hasn't committed to a direction, understand intent before picking colors:

- **Audience** — who watches this? Developers? Executives? General consumers?
- **Platform** — where does it play? Social (15s), website hero, product demo, internal?
- **Priority** — what matters most? Motion quality? Content accuracy? Brand fidelity? Speed?
- **Variations** — does the user want options, or a single best shot?

For specific requests ("add a title card", "fix the timing on scene 3"), skip discovery.

For exploratory requests, consider offering 2-3 variations that differ meaningfully — not just color swaps, but different pacing, energy levels, or structural approaches. One safe/expected, one ambitious. Don't mandate this — it's a tool available when appropriate.

### Step 1: Design system

If `design.md` or `DESIGN.md` exists in the project, read it first (check both casings — they're different files on Linux). It's the source of truth for brand colors, fonts, and constraints. Use its exact values — don't invent colors or substitute fonts. Any format works (YAML frontmatter, prose, tables — just extract the values).

If it names fonts you can't find locally (no `fonts/` directory with `.woff2` files, not a built-in font), warn the user before writing HTML: "design.md specifies [font name] but no font files found. Please add .woff2 files to `fonts/` or I'll fall back to [closest built-in alternative]."

If no `design.md` exists, offer the user a choice:

1. **User named a style or mood?** → Read [visual-styles.md](./visual-styles.md) for the 8 named presets. Pick the closest match.
2. **Want to browse options visually?** → Run the design picker: read [references/design-picker.md](references/design-picker.md) for the full workflow. This serves a visual picker page. The user configures mood, palette, typography, and motion in the browser, then copies the generated design.md and pastes it back into the conversation.
3. **Want to skip and go fast?** → Ask: mood, light or dark, any brand colors/fonts? Then pick a palette from [house-style.md](./house-style.md).

**design.md defines the brand. It does not define video composition rules.** Those come from [references/video-composition.md](references/video-composition.md) and [house-style.md](./house-style.md). Use brand colors at video-appropriate scale — not at web-UI opacity.

### Step 2: Prompt expansion

Always run on every composition (except single-scene pieces and trivial edits). This step grounds the user's intent against `design.md` and `house-style.md` and produces a consistent intermediate that every downstream agent reads the same way.

Read [references/prompt-expansion.md](references/prompt-expansion.md) for the full process and output format.

### Step 3: Plan

Before writing HTML, think at a high level:

1. **What** — what should the viewer experience? Identify the narrative arc, key moments, and emotional beats.
2. **Structure** — how many compositions, which are sub-compositions vs inline, what tracks carry what (video, audio, overlays, captions).
3. **Rhythm** — declare your scene rhythm before implementing. Which scenes are quick hits, which are holds, where do shaders land, where does energy peak. Name the pattern: fast-fast-SLOW-fast-SHADER-hold. Read [references/beat-direction.md](references/beat-direction.md) for rhythm templates.
4. **Timing** — which clips drive the duration, where do transitions land, what's the pacing.
5. **Layout** — build the end-state first. See "Layout Before Animation" below.
6. **Animate** — then add motion using the rules below.

**Build what was asked.** A request for "a title card" is not a request for "a title card + 3 supporting scenes + ambient music + captions." Every scene, every element, every tween should earn its place. If additional scenes or elements would genuinely improve the piece, propose them — don't add them.

For small edits (fix a color, adjust timing, add one element), skip straight to the rules.

<HARD-GATE>
Before writing ANY composition HTML — verify you have a visual identity from Step 1. If you're reaching for `#333`, `#3b82f6`, or `Roboto`, you skipped it.
</HARD-GATE>

## Layout Before Animation

Position every element where it should be at its **most visible moment** — the frame where it's fully entered, correctly placed, and not yet exiting. Write this as static HTML+CSS first. No GSAP yet.

**Why this matters:** If you position elements at their animated start state (offscreen, scaled to 0, opacity 0) and tween them to where you think they should land, you're guessing the final layout. Overlaps are invisible until the video renders. By building the end state first, you can see and fix layout problems before adding any motion.

### The process

1. **Identify the hero frame** for each scene — the moment when the most elements are simultaneously visible. This is the layout you build.
2. **Write static CSS** for that frame. The `.scene-content` container MUST fill the full scene using `width: 100%; height: 100%; padding: Npx;` with `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: Npx; box-sizing: border-box`. Use padding to push content inward — NEVER `position: absolute; top: Npx` on a content container. Absolute-positioned content containers overflow when content is taller than the remaining space. Reserve `position: absolute` for decoratives only.
3. **Add entrances with `gsap.from()`** — animate FROM offscreen/invisible TO the CSS position. The CSS position is the ground truth; the tween describes the journey to get there. (In sub-compositions loaded via `data-composition-src`, prefer `gsap.fromTo()` — see load-bearing GSAP rules in [references/motion-principles.md](references/motion-principles.md).)
4. **Add exits with `gsap.to()`** — animate TO offscreen/invisible FROM the CSS position.

### Example

```css
/* scene-content fills the scene, padding positions content */
.scene-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 120px 160px;
  gap: 24px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
.title {
  font-size: 120px;
}
.subtitle {
  font-size: 42px;
}
/* Container fills any scene size (1920x1080, 1080x1920, etc).
   Padding positions content. Flex + gap handles spacing. */
```

**WRONG — hardcoded dimensions and absolute positioning:**

```css
.scene-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 160px;
  width: 1920px;
  height: 1080px;
  display: flex; /* ... */
}
```

```js
// Step 3: Animate INTO those positions
tl.from(".title", { y: 60, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "power3.out" }, 0);
tl.from(".subtitle", { y: 40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.2);
tl.from(".logo", { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.3);

// Step 4: Animate OUT from those positions
tl.to(".title", { y: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.in" }, 3);
tl.to(".subtitle", { y: -30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.1);
tl.to(".logo", { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.in" }, 3.2);
```

### When elements share space across time

If element A exits before element B enters in the same area, both should have correct CSS positions for their respective hero frames. The timeline ordering guarantees they never visually coexist — but if you skip the layout step, you won't catch the case where they accidentally overlap due to a timing error.

### What counts as intentional overlap

Layered effects (glow behind text, shadow elements, background patterns) and z-stacked designs (card stacks, depth layers) are intentional. The layout step is about catching **unintentional** overlap — two headlines landing on top of each other, a stat covering a label, content bleeding off-frame.

## Data Attributes

### All Clips

| Attribute          | Required                          | Values                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`               | Yes                               | Unique identifier                                      |
| `data-start`       | Yes                               | Seconds or clip ID reference (`"el-1"`, `"intro + 2"`) |
| `data-duration`    | Required for img/div/compositions | Seconds. Video/audio defaults to media duration.       |
| `data-track-index` | Yes                               | Integer. Same-track clips cannot overlap.              |
| `data-media-start` | No                                | Trim offset into source (seconds)                      |
| `data-volume`      | No                                | 0-1 (default 1)                                        |

`data-track-index` does **not** affect visual layering — use CSS `z-index`.

### Composition Clips

| Attribute                    | Required | Values                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `data-composition-id`        | Yes      | Unique composition ID                        |
| `data-start`                 | Yes      | Start time (root composition: use `"0"`)     |
| `data-duration`              | Yes      | Takes precedence over GSAP timeline duration |
| `data-width` / `data-height` | Yes      | Pixel dimensions (1920x1080 or 1080x1920)    |
| `data-composition-src`       | No       | Path to external HTML file                   |

## Composition Structure

Sub-compositions loaded via `data-composition-src` use a `<template>` wrapper. **Standalone compositions (the main index.html) do NOT use `<template>`** — they put the `data-composition-id` div directly in `<body>`. Using `<template>` on a standalone file hides all content from the browser and breaks rendering.

Sub-composition structure:

```html
<template id="my-comp-template">
  <div data-composition-id="my-comp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080">
    <!-- content -->
    <style>
      [data-composition-id="my-comp"] {
        /* scoped styles */
      }
    </style>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/gsap.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.__timelines = window.__timelines || {};
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ paused: true });
      // tweens...
      window.__timelines["my-comp"] = tl;
    </script>
  </div>
</template>
```

Load in root: `<div id="el-1" data-composition-id="my-comp" data-composition-src="compositions/my-comp.html" data-start="0" data-duration="10" data-track-index="1"></div>`

## Video and Audio

Video must be `muted playsinline`. Audio is always a separate `<audio>` element:

```html
<video
  id="el-v"
  data-start="0"
  data-duration="30"
  data-track-index="0"
  src="video.mp4"
  muted
  playsinline
></video>
<audio
  id="el-a"
  data-start="0"
  data-duration="30"
  data-track-index="2"
  src="video.mp4"
  data-volume="1"
></audio>
```

## Timeline Contract

- All timelines start `{ paused: true }` — the player controls playback
- Register every timeline: `window.__timelines["<composition-id>"] = tl`
- Framework auto-nests sub-timelines — do NOT manually add them
- Duration comes from `data-duration`, not from GSAP timeline length
- Never create empty tweens to set duration

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

**Deterministic:** No `Math.random()`, `Date.now()`, or time-based logic. Use a seeded PRNG if you need pseudo-random values (e.g. mulberry32).

**GSAP:** Only animate visual properties (`opacity`, `x`, `y`, `scale`, `rotation`, `color`, `backgroundColor`, `borderRadius`, transforms). Do NOT animate `visibility`, `display`, or call `video.play()`/`audio.play()`.

**Animation conflicts:** Never animate the same property on the same element from multiple timelines simultaneously.

**No `repeat: -1`:** Infinite-repeat timelines break the capture engine. Calculate the exact repeat count from composition duration: `repeat: Math.ceil(duration / cycleDuration) - 1`.

**Synchronous timeline construction:** Never build timelines inside `async`/`await`, `setTimeout`, or Promises. The capture engine reads `window.__timelines` synchronously after page load. Fonts are embedded by the compiler, so they're available immediately — no need to wait for font loading.

**Never do:**

1. Forget `window.__timelines` registration
2. Use video for audio — always muted video + separate `<audio>`
3. Nest video inside a timed div — use a non-timed wrapper
4. Use `data-layer` (use `data-track-index`) or `data-end` (use `data-duration`)
5. Animate video element dimensions — animate a wrapper div
6. Call play/pause/seek on media — framework owns playback
7. Create a top-level container without `data-composition-id`
8. Use `repeat: -1` on any timeline or tween — always finite repeats
9. Build timelines asynchronously (inside `async`, `setTimeout`, `Promise`)
10. Use `gsap.set()` on clip elements from later scenes — they don't exist in the DOM at page load. Use `tl.set(selector, vars, timePosition)` inside the timeline at or after the clip's `data-start` time instead.
11. Use `<br>` in content text — forced line breaks don't account for actual rendered font width. Text that wraps naturally + a `<br>` produces an extra unwanted break, causing overlap. Let text wrap via `max-width` instead. Exception: short display titles where each word is deliberately on its own line (e.g., "THE\nIMMORTAL\nGAME" at 130px).

## Scene Transitions (Non-Negotiable)

Every multi-scene composition MUST follow ALL of these rules. Violating any one of them is a broken composition.

1. **ALWAYS use transitions between scenes.** No jump cuts. No exceptions.
2. **ALWAYS use entrance animations on every scene.** Every element animates IN via `gsap.from()`. No element may appear fully-formed. If a scene has 5 elements, it needs 5 entrance tweens.
3. **NEVER use exit animations** except on the final scene. This means: NO `gsap.to()` that animates opacity to 0, y offscreen, scale to 0, or any other "out" animation before a transition fires. The transition IS the exit. The outgoing scene's content MUST be fully visible at the moment the transition starts.
4. **Final scene only:** The last scene may fade elements out (e.g., fade to black). This is the ONLY scene where `gsap.to(..., { opacity: 0 })` is allowed.

**WRONG — exit animation before transition:**

```js
// BANNED — this empties the scene before the transition can use it
tl.to("#s1-title", { opacity: 0, y: -40, duration: 0.4 }, 6.5);
tl.to("#s1-subtitle", { opacity: 0, duration: 0.3 }, 6.7);
// transition fires on empty frame
```

**RIGHT — entrance only, transition handles exit:**

```js
// Scene 1 entrance animations
tl.from("#s1-title", { y: 50, opacity: 0, duration: 0.7, ease: "power3.out" }, 0.3);
tl.from("#s1-subtitle", { y: 30, opacity: 0, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// NO exit tweens — transition at 7.2s handles the scene change
// Scene 2 entrance animations
tl.from("#s2-heading", { x: -40, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6, ease: "expo.out" }, 8.0);
```

## Animation Guardrails

- Offset first animation 0.1-0.3s (not t=0)
- Vary eases across entrance tweens — use at least 3 different eases per scene
- Don't repeat an entrance pattern within a scene
- Avoid full-screen linear gradients on dark backgrounds (H.264 banding — use radial or solid + localized glow)
- 60px+ headlines, 20px+ body, 16px+ data labels for rendered video
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on number columns

If no `design.md` exists, follow [house-style.md](./house-style.md) for aesthetic defaults.

## Typography and Assets

- **Built-in fonts:** Write the `font-family` you want in CSS — the compiler embeds supported fonts automatically.
- **Custom fonts:** If design.md names a font that isn't built-in, the user must provide `.woff2` files in a `fonts/` directory. If missing, warn before writing HTML. When files exist, add `@font-face` declarations pointing to the local files.
- Add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to external media
- For dynamic text overflow, use `window.__hyperframes.fitTextFontSize(text, { maxWidth, fontFamily, fontWeight })`
- All files live at the project root alongside `index.html`; sub-compositions use `../`

## Editing Existing Compositions

- **Read actual files, don't guess.** When editing, extending, or creating companion compositions, read the existing source. Don't reconstruct hex codes from memory. Don't guess GSAP easing patterns. The composition IS the spec — extract exact values from it.
- Match existing fonts, colors, animation patterns from what you read
- Only change what was requested
- Preserve timing of unrelated clips

## Output Checklist

**Fast (run immediately, block on results):**

- [ ] `npx hyperframes lint` and `npx hyperframes validate` both pass
- [ ] Design adherence verified if design.md exists

**Slow (run in parallel while presenting the preview to the user):**

- [ ] `npx hyperframes inspect` passes, or every reported overflow is intentionally marked
- [ ] Contrast warnings addressed (see Quality Checks below)
- [ ] Animation choreography verified (see Quality Checks below)

## Quality Checks

### Visual Inspect

`hyperframes inspect` runs the composition in headless Chrome, seeks through the timeline, and maps visual layout issues with timestamps, selectors, bounding boxes, and fix hints. Run it after `lint` and `validate`:

```bash
npx hyperframes inspect
npx hyperframes inspect --json
```

Failures usually mean text is spilling out of a bubble/card, a fixed-size label is clipping dynamic copy, or text has moved off the canvas. Fix by increasing container size or padding, reducing font size or letter spacing, adding a real `max-width` so text wraps inside the container, or using `window.__hyperframes.fitTextFontSize(...)` for dynamic copy.

Use `--samples 15` for dense videos and `--at 1.5,4,7.25` for specific hero frames. Repeated static issues are collapsed by default to avoid flooding agent context. If overflow is intentional for an entrance/exit animation, mark the element or ancestor with `data-layout-allow-overflow`. If a decorative element should never be audited, mark it with `data-layout-ignore`.

`hyperframes layout` is the compatibility alias for the same check.

### Contrast

`hyperframes validate` runs a WCAG contrast audit by default. It seeks to 5 timestamps, screenshots the page, samples background pixels behind every text element, and computes contrast ratios. Failures appear as warnings:

```
⚠ WCAG AA contrast warnings (3):
  · .subtitle "secondary text" — 2.67:1 (need 4.5:1, t=5.3s)
```

If warnings appear:

- On dark backgrounds: brighten the failing color until it clears 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text, 24px+ or 19px+ bold)
- On light backgrounds: darken it
- Stay within the palette family — don't invent a new color, adjust the existing one
- Re-run `hyperframes validate` until clean

Use `--no-contrast` to skip if iterating rapidly and you'll check later.

### Design Adherence

If a `design.md` exists, verify the composition follows it after authoring. Read the HTML and check:

1. **Colors** — every hex value in the composition appears in design.md's palette section (however the user labeled it: Colors, Palette, Theme, etc.). Flag any invented colors.
2. **Typography** — font families and weights match design.md's type spec. No substitutions.
3. **Corners** — border-radius values match the declared corner style, if specified.
4. **Spacing** — padding and gap values fall within the declared density range, if specified.
5. **Depth** — shadow usage matches the declared depth level, if specified (flat = none, subtle = light, layered = glows).
6. **Avoidance rules** — if design.md has a section listing things to avoid (commonly "What NOT to Do", "Don'ts", "Anti-patterns", or "Do's and Don'ts"), verify none are present.

Report violations as a checklist. Fix each one before serving.

If no `design.md` exists (house-style-only path), verify:

1. **Palette consistency** — the same bg, fg, and accent colors are used across all scenes. No per-scene color invention.
2. **No lazy defaults** — check the composition against house-style.md's "Lazy Defaults to Question" list. If any appear, they must be a deliberate choice for the content, not a default.

### Animation Map

After authoring animations, run the animation map to verify choreography:

```bash
node skills/hyperframes/scripts/animation-map.mjs <composition-dir> \
  --out <composition-dir>/.hyperframes/anim-map
```

Outputs a single `animation-map.json` with:

- **Per-tween summaries**: `"#card1 animates opacity+y over 0.50s. moves 23px up. fades in. ends at (120, 200)"`
- **ASCII timeline**: Gantt chart of all tweens across the composition duration
- **Stagger detection**: reports actual intervals (`"3 elements stagger at 120ms"`)
- **Dead zones**: periods over 1s with no animation — intentional hold or missing entrance?
- **Element lifecycles**: first/last animation time, final visibility
- **Scene snapshots**: visible element state at 5 key timestamps
- **Flags**: `offscreen`, `collision`, `invisible`, `paced-fast` (under 0.2s), `paced-slow` (over 2s)

Read the JSON. Scan summaries for anything unexpected. Check every flag — fix or justify. Verify the timeline shows the intended choreography rhythm. Re-run after fixes.

Skip on small edits (fixing a color, adjusting one duration). Run on new compositions and significant animation changes.
