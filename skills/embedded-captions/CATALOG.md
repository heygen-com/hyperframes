# THE CATALOG — one front-end, three engines behind

This is the skill's single selection surface. **The user picks an IDENTITY from
this table; everything else (engine, compiler, authoring file) is derived by
lookup — never ask the user (or yourself) "Standard or Cinematic or Theme?"**
Those are backend names; a product has one UX even when it has several engines.

Routing procedure (replaces any mode decision):

1. Probe the clip (decision gate + pre-flight probes as in SKILL.md).
2. Shortlist 2–3 identities from this table by **content register + the user's
   own words + scene constraints**.
3. Recommend ONE with a one-line why; the user picks.
4. Author the identity's file (last column), then render with its engine's
   pipeline. Done — no category question ever surfaced.

## Shortlisting heuristics (identity-level, not category-level)

- **"每个词都要被读到 / accessibility / 教程·新闻"** → rail or panel surfaces:
  `keynote · rail`, `cream · rail`, `ordnance`, `terminal` (all verbatim by construction).
- **"嵌进场景 / 电影感 / 高级"** → the column-flow ten; pick by register + scene luma
  (bright → `ink`; warm dark → `cream`; fashion → `editorial`; …).
- **"炸 / 特效 / 酷炫 / 像 AE"** → `ordnance`, `stomp`, `terminal`, `loud` — pick by
  what should explode: a word (`ordnance`), the frame (`stomp`), a decode (`terminal`),
  every beat (`loud`).
- **Named worlds** → direct hits: 控制台/终端 → `terminal`; 霓虹/招牌 → `neonsign`;
  诗/星尘/记忆 → `stardust`; 军事/重击 → `ordnance`; 预言/未来/悬念揭示 → `lastpage`;
  赛博朋克/游戏封面/夜之城 → `nightcity`.
- **Scene constraints veto last**: luma > 180 kills cream/screen column looks
  (→ `ink` or a rail/panel surface); dusk/dark unlocks `neon`/`neonsign`.
- **Unsure** → `keynote · rail` (the conservative default: words read, scene safe).

Adjacencies worth knowing (these pairs are why the old mode question was hard —
recommend by the difference, don't agonize over category): `loud` vs `ordnance`
(percussive type vs a themed world with plate reaction) · `neon` vs `neonsign`
(neon-styled captions vs a sign being written) · `cream` vs `stardust` (warm
embedded flow vs an accumulating poem with semantic dispersal) · `terminal` vs
`glitch` (a console WORLD with typed log + decode vs corrupted-feed styling on
normal captions) · `stomp` vs `loud` (every beat takes over the dead-center
frame vs energetic type that still shares the frame with the subject).

## Rules

- Identities are **engine-locked** — no cross combos. Opening a new combo (e.g.
  another DNA under rail) is a validation event: render → user review → flip the
  DNA's `deliveries.rail` flag (see dna/README.md).
