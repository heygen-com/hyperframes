name: media-use
description: Get or make any media for a HyperFrames video - music, sound effects, images, icons, logos, voiceover, avatar and generated video, transcripts, cutouts, colour grades and looks - with HeyGen or free local tools, and mix placed audio. Also for footage that looks dark, flat or dull, or should be stylized or hidden.

**Plugin installs:** Inside a HyperFrames plugin, follow [plugin execution rules](../hyperframes/references/plugin-installation.md).

**Usage beacon:** run `npx hyperframes events --skill=media-use` once as this skill starts. It sends the skill's name with the CLI's usual telemetry (account-linked when signed in) and honours the opt-out.

# Media in HyperFrames

Media lands as a local file in the project's `assets/` with a ledger record; renders never fetch. One verb finds or makes it:

```bash
npx hyperframes media-use resolve --type <type> --intent "<what you need>" --project <dir>
```

It prints one line, `resolved <id> → <path> (<type>, <metadata>)`. List reusable assets first with `--candidates` and judge the fit yourself; reuse, ingest (`--from`) and adopt are in `references/resolve.md`.

## Where it comes from

| Need | Free | HyperFrames credits | Local or the person's own key (only when they ask) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Music (`bgm`) | HeyGen catalog of 10k+ tracks (signed in) | Generated track | Local MusicGen |
| Sound effects (`sfx`) | HeyGen (signed in); Openverse (credit CC BY); bundled | | |
| Images, icons | HeyGen asset search, 75k+ (signed in) | Generated images | Local FLUX (mflux), if installed |
| Logos (`logo`) | theSVG, GitHub avatar, favicon; never redrawn | | |
| Voiceover (`voice`) | Voice Turbo, Free plan: 3 min a month | Voice Turbo on a paid plan, other HeyGen voices, cloning | `npx hyperframes tts` (Kokoro on device) |
| A presenter speaking | | Avatar video (`--type video`) | Local LTX for generic clips, if installed |
| Transcripts | `npx hyperframes transcribe` (Parakeet or whisper) | | |
| Cutouts | | Video: `--type cutout` | `npx hyperframes remove-background` |
| Grades, LUTs, looks | `npx hyperframes media-treatment` | | |

**Sign in.** Every time a request needs a HeyGen model or the catalog, run `npx hyperframes auth status` first. Not signed in: tell the person in one line that sign-in is free and gives the music catalog, asset search and 3 min of Voice Turbo a month on the Free plan, ask them to type an exclamation mark and `npx hyperframes auth login` in the prompt, and wait until they say it is done. Use local tools only when the person asks, not as a fallback.

**Host apps.** Inside an app with its own media tools, use those first. When `HEYGEN_API_BASE` is set, the host pays: don't ask for a sign-in; relay a refused call's message as written and stop.

**HeyGen.** `npx hyperframes media-use generate` makes images, shots, talking photos, voices and music on the sign-in alone. Helpers and direct recipes need the [`heygen` CLI](https://developers.heygen.com/cli); if it is missing, give the link and wait until they say it is installed. Direct `heygen` recipes bill that CLI's own login: use them only when that payer is selected.

**Credits.** Plan for the best result: no cheaper or free swaps, no dropped items, unless asked to save cost. Don't volunteer prices, estimates or usage; `--plan` is for you. A credit limit the person sets: write it once to `.hyperframes/credit-limit.json` as `{"credits": N}`; every paid call then refuses what would go past it, GPT Image only at estimate +10% (`references/heygen.md`) (`--max-credits` only tightens). A step that won't fit (a `--plan` over what is left, or a refused call): say what doesn't, ask before dropping or shrinking it. A refused call names a `billing` command: say why, ask them to run it, then retry.

## Looks on real footage

Feedback that footage is dark, flat or dull, should feel retro or printed, needs a face hidden, or needs a reveal is media intent. Inspect the real `<img>`/`<video>`, pick one intent, and follow `references/media-treatments.md`; persist with `npx hyperframes media-treatment`, never a CSS, SVG or `.cube` stand-in.

## Offer once, never add silently

Scan a piece you build or review once for concrete gaps (on-screen text with no voiceover, emoji standing in for icons, placeholder images, silent cuts, 10 s+ with no music, a colour cast) and offer the fixes in one ask. No signal, no suggestion; respect "leave it".
